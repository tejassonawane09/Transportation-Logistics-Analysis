# Transportation & Logistics Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes transportation and logistics operations to identify delivery delays, cost inefficiencies, and performance gaps. The goal is to help businesses improve delivery time, reduce delays, and optimize costs using data-driven insights.

---

## Business Problem
Logistics companies often face issues such as:
- Late deliveries
- High delivery costs
- Inefficient routes
- Uneven driver performance

This project addresses these problems using SQL, Python, and Power BI.

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **MySQL** – Database design, data storage, SQL analysis
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** – Data analysis and insights
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard and visualization

---

## Project Workflow

### Step 1: Problem Understanding
Defined logistics challenges and project objectives.

### Step 2: Data Understanding & Table Design
Designed tables for deliveries, orders, drivers, vehicles, and routes.

### Step 3: SQL Schema Creation
Created structured tables with proper relationships.

### Step 4: Data Insertion
Inserted realistic sample data for analysis.

### Step 5: Business Questions & Planning
Defined 10 key business questions to guide analysis.

### Step 6: SQL Execution & Insights
Executed SQL queries and derived business insights.

### Step 7: Python Analysis
Used Python in Jupyter Notebook to analyze delays, drivers, routes, and delivery patterns.

### Step 8: Power BI Dashboard
Built an interactive dashboard showing KPIs, delivery performance, delays, and cost analysis.

---

## Key Insights
- Certain routes and regions experience frequent delays
- A small number of drivers cause most delivery delays
- Some routes are unprofitable due to high delivery costs
- Delays are higher on specific days of the week

---

## Power BI Dashboard Highlights
- Total Deliveries
- Delayed Deliveries & Delay Percentage
- Average Delivery Time
- Driver Performance Analysis
- Route & Region Delay Analysis
- Cost vs Revenue Comparison

---

## Project Outcome
This project provides actionable insights to improve logistics efficiency, reduce delays, and control delivery costs. It demonstrates strong skills in SQL, Python analysis, and dashboard storytelling.

---

## Repository Structure
- SQL Scripts
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
- Power BI Dashboard (.pbix)
- Documentation (.md files)
